> The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice 
each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the [Dexterity](dexterity) ([Stealth](stealth)) checks of anyone hiding with the passive 
[Wisdom](wisdom) ([Perception](perception)) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't 
notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
>
> If you're surprised, you can't move or take an [action](action) on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a [reaction](reaction) until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.
