**Class features do not stack!** {.text-center}

**Channel Divinity**. Characters do not gain extra uses of Channel Divinity, just more options from the new class.<br/>

**[Extra Attack](extra-attack)**. Characters do not get extra [extra attacks](extra-attack). They always use the more powerful feature (i.e. Fighter). 

**Thirsting Blade**. A warlock cannot combine this feature with [Extra Attack](extra-attack) for more attacks. It's one or the other.

**Unarmored Defense**. This feature may only be earned once and can not be picked up again.
