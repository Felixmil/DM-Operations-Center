### Craft Item
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Downtime](downtime-menu) > Craft Item {.small-text}

The time & materials needed to craft an item are:
- Time = Item Value / 5
- Cost = Item Value / 2
{.square}

The creator & any assistants must be proficient with the appropriate tools for the task. Assistants reduce the labor requirement equally. 

**Total Time / # of Qualified Assistants** {.text-center}

While crafting, the creator can maintain a [modest lifestyle](lifestyle) at no cost or 1/2 a [comfortable](lifestyle)) one.
