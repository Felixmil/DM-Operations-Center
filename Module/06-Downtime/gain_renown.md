[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Downtime](downtime-menu) > Gain Renown {.small-text}

A character may perform jobs for a faction to which they belong to gain renown within that faction. To increase their renown by 1, they must devote:

**# of Days = Current Renown x 10** {.text-center}

***Note**: This rule applies to gaining renown with a faction a character is already affiliated with, not in the world at large.* {.small-text}
