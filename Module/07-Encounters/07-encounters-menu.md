I have ambitious plans for this module and a limited amount of talent and time. If you're familiar with javascript and willing to help, contact me via <a href="https://github.com/MrFarland">GitHub</a>.</p>

The vision for this section includes the following features:

- **Random encounters** based on terrain and tier.
- **Chase** tools & tables for running engagements.
- **Skill Challenges** for a variety of scenarios.
- **Naval Encounters** for ships, desert islands, & more.
- **Puzzles** easy enough for a ~~child's~~ typical D&D party. 
- **Traps** to wound, maim or kill blundering adventurers.
