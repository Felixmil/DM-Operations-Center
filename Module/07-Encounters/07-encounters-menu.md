#### Gondor calls for aid! {.text-center}

I have ambitious plans for this module and a limited amount of talent and time. If your familiar with javascript and willing to help contact me via <a href="https://github.com/MrFarland">GitHub</a>.</p>

The vision for this section includes the following features:

- **Random encounters** based on terrain and tier.
- **Chase** tools & tables for running engagements.
- **Skill Challenges** for a variety of scenarios.
- **Naval Encounters** for ship, desert islands, & more.
- **Puzzles** easy enough for a ~~child~~ typical D&D party. 
- **Traps** to wound, maim or kill blundering adventurers.
