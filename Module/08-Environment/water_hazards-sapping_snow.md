The powdery remains of dead organism that cover the ocean floor and are imbued with necromantic magic. A creature that starts its turn touching sapping snow must make a [DC](difficulty-class) 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
- [HP](HIT-POINTS) Max decreases by amount of damage
- Reduction lasts until finishing a long rest

If the damage reduces the creature to 0 [HP](HIT-POINTS), they die immediately and crumbles into the sapping snow.
