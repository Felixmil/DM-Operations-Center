Slippery ice is difficult terrain and a creature moving on to it for the first time must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

> **MrFarland House Rule**<br/>
> Creatures repeat the dexterity saving throw each time they change direction **IF** they move faster than 1/2 their normal movement.
>
> A creature that fails this dexterity saving throw falls prone and slides an additional 5' in the direction they were heading before attempting to change directions.
