[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Environment](environment) > [Water Hazards](water-hazards) > Whirlpool {.small-text}

A swirling vortex of water that sucks creatures and ships towards its center.

| Rank | Diameter (Depth 1/2) | Velocity | DC |
| :----: | -------------------------: | :--------: | :--: |
|   1    |                 22 (4d10)' |     5'     |  5   |
|   2    |                55 (10d10)' |    15'     |  10  |

#### Creatures
Make a [Strength](strength) ([Athletics](athletics)) check upon entering or starting it's turn inside the whirlpool.

On a failure:
- Moved towards center (distance = whirlpool velocity)
- Restrained until the start of it's next turn.
- At the center, it is pulled under and appears:
    - A number of feet equal to velocity
    - or a special location.

On a success:
- May move normally, but it is difficult terrain

#### Vessels (Length < Diameter)
Officers and crew make a group hazard check to escape. It represents 5 minutes of work and the [DC](difficulty-class) is chosen randomly or using a d4 on the table above.

| Group Check |                                    |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Captain         | Intelligence (Water Vehicle)       |
| First Mate      | [Charisma](charisma) (Intimidation/Persuasion) |
| Bosun           | Strength (Carpenter's Tools)       |
| Quartermaster   | Wisdom (Nature)                    |
| Crew            | Quality Score                      |
{.gray .small-text}

| Results ||
|:-------------|-|
| Total Success | Increases speed by 20' in current turn. |
| Success       | The vessel can move normally. |
| Failure       | Moved toward center at whirlpool velocity, restrained until start of next turn |
| Total Failure | As a failure. Additionally, if in whirlpool at start of next turn, repeat checks have disadvantage on that turn |
