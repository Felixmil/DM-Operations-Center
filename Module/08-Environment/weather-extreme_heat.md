At or above 100Â°F, a creature without access to water must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 1 for each additional hour.

Creatures wearing heavy armor or clothing have disadvantage on the saving throw.

Creatures automatically succed if they:
- have resistance or immunity to fire,
- are naturally adapted to hot climates.
