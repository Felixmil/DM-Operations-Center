I have ambitious plans for this module and a limited amount of talent and time. If you're familiar with javascript and willing to help, contact me via <a href="https://github.com/MrFarland">GitHub</a>.</p>

The vision for this generator includes the following features:

- **Menu**. A variety of food choices, based on cultures and location.
- **Staff & Patrons** Quick NPCs to populate the inn or tavern.
- **Rumors**. Rumors and other plot hooks.
