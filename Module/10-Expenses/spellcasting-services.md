These prices are just a rough guide and should be considered a starting price. Other factors may influence these prices based on:
- Reputation of the characters.
- Standing with the caster's faction.
- Availability of consumed components.
- Prevalence of magic/casters in the world.
{.square}

Even if a caster of high enough level is available, spells above a certain level are not for sale. The characters may need to convince or perform a task for the caster to persuade them to cast it.
