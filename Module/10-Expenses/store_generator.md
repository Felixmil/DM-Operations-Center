I have ambitious plans for this module and a limited amount of talent and time. If your familiar with javascript and willing to help contact me via <a href="https://github.com/MrFarland">GitHub</a>.</p>

The vision for this generator includes the following features:

- **Inventory** based on settlement size with variable pricing.
- **Staff & Patrons** Quick NPCs to populate the store.
- **Variety**. Enough shop templates to make your own mall.
