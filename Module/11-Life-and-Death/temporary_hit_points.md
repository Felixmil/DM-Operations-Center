 [Home](dm-operations-center) > [Life & Death](life-and-death-menu) > Temporary Hit Points {.small-text}

Temporary Hit Points:
- are not actual [hit points](hit-points), just a buffer,
- are used first, **before** regular [hit points](hit-points),
- can exceed a character's [HP](hit-points) maximum.
- **DO NOT HEAL** or [stabilize](stablizing).

**Temporary Hit Points do not stack!**<br/>
Subsequent grants replace prior grants. {.text-center}
