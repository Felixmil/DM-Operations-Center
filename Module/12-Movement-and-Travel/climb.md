### Climb
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Movement](movement) > Climb {.small-text}

Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when the character is climbing.

This extra costs can be ignored if the character has a climbing speed.

Climbing a slippery surface or if few handholds are particularly difficult, the DM can ask for a Strength (Athletics) check.
