#### Long Jump

The maximum length of the jump is calculated from Strength score:
- With at least 10 feet momentum, length = Strength 
- Without momentum, length = Strength / 2

This assumes that there is no obstacle in the trajectory. If the characters wants to jump above a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance) such as a hedge or a wall, the DM can ask for a DC 10 Stregth (Athletics) check. If failed, the character hits the obstacle.

When the character lands in difficult terrain, it must succed a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on its feet. Otherwise, it lands [prone](../05-Conditions/prone.md).

#### High Jump

The maximum height is calculated from Strength modifier:
- With at least 10 feet momentum: height = 3 + Strength Modifier (Minimum of 0 feet)
- Without moment, height = (3 + Strength Modifier) / 2

Each jumped foot costs a foot of movement.

In some circumstances, a Stength (Athletics) check can be asked to the character to jump higher.

The character can extends its arms above himself to reach a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1Â½ times its height.
