### Climb
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Movement](movement) > Climb {.small-text}

**1' Climbing = 2' of Movement (3' if Difficult Terrain)** {.text-center}

Extra cost is ignored if creature has a climbing speed.

Climbing a slippery surface or if few handholds are particularly difficult, the DM can ask for a [Strength](strength) ([Athletics](athletics)) check.

Characters with climbing gear or a rope have advantage on climbing related checks.
