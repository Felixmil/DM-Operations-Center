### Swim
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Movement](movement-menu) > Swim {.small-text}

**1' Swimming = 2' of Movement (3' [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain))** {.text-center}

The extra cost is ignored if a creature has a swim speed. {.text-center}

#### Long Distance
Creatures without a swim speed cannot swim long distances without magical assistance.

**1pt [Exhaustion](exhaustion) = [DC](difficulty-class) 10 [CON](CONSTITUTION) over 8 hours** {.text-center}

Creatures with a swim speed do not make this check and follow the same rules as a [Forced March](forced-march).

#### Deep Water
Swimming in deep water is similar to traveling at [high altitude](high-altitude).
