**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

***Examples**: [Disguise Self](/spell/disguise-self), [Fear](/spell/fear), [Major Image](/spell/major-image), [Invisibility](/spell/invisibility), [Silence](/spell/silence), [Silent Image](/spell/silent-image)*
