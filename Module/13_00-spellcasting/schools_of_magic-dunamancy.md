**Dunamancy** is devoted to the study of Dunamis, an arcane power rooted in the very fabric of time and space. Practioners of this school are very rare and can only be found on the Material Plan of Exandria.

***Examples**: [Fortune's Favor](/spell/fortunes-favor), [Immovable Object](/spell/immovable-object), [Gravity Sinkhole](/spell/gravity-sinkhole), and [Gravity Fissure](/spell/gravity-fissure)*
