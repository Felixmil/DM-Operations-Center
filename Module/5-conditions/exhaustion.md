### Exhaustion
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

|Level| Effect |
|:---:|:-----------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
|  2  | Speed halved                                   |
|  3  | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
|  4  | Hit point maximum halved                       |
|  5  | Speed reduced to 0                             |
|  6  | Death                                          |

- If an exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.
- A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.
- An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description.
- All exhaustion ends if a creature's level is reduced below 1.
- Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion by 1, provided the creature has also had food & drink.
