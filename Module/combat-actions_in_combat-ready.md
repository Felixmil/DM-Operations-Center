> First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your [reaction](reaction). Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.
>
> When the trigger occurs, you can either take your [reaction](reaction) right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. 
> 
> When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your [reaction](reaction) when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a [casting time](casting-time) of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires [concentration](concentration). If your [concentration](concentration) is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your [reaction](reaction), your [concentration](concentration) might be broken.
