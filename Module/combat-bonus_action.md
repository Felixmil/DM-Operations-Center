> You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take. 
>
> You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available. 
> 
> You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take [actions](action) also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
