> There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. 
> 
> A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to [AC](armor-class) and [Dexterity](dexterity) [saving throws](saving-throw). A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. 
>
> A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to [AC](armor-class) and [Dexterity](dexterity) [saving throws](saving-throw). A target has three quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. 
>
> A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an [area of effect](area-of-effect). A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
