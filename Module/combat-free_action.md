> Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your [action](action) nor your [move](movement).
>
> You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn. 
>
> You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. 
>
> If you want to interact with a second object, you need to [use your action](use-object). Some magic items and other special objects always require an [action](action) to use, as stated in their descriptions. 
>
> The DM might require you to use an [action](action) for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an [action](action) to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
