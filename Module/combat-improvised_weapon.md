> An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a 
wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. 
>
> Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her [proficiency_bonus](proficiency_bonus).
>
> An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals [ld4](/roll/1d4) damage (the DM assigns a [damage type](damage-type) appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a [melee attack](melee-attack), or throws a melee weapon that does not have the [thrown](weapon-properties) property, it also deals [ld4](/roll/1d4) damage. An improvised [thrown](weapon-properties) weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
