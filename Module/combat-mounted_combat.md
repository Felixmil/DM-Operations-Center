**Mounting & Dismounting**
- Willing creature at least 1 size larger.
- May mount or dismount once per turn.
- Must use 1/2 movement to mount a creature.
{.square}

**Getting Knocked Off**<br/>
A rider must make a [DC](difficulty-class) 10 [DEX](dexterity) [save](saving-throw) to avoid falling off their mount and landing [prone](prone) within 5' of the mount if:
- The mount is moved against its will.
- The rider is knocked [prone](prone) while riding.
{.square}

If the mount is knocked [prone](prone), the rider may use their reaction to land on their feet, or fall [prone](prone) within 5' of the mount.

**Controlling a Mount**<br/>
| Type | Init | Actions |
|-|-|
| **Controlled**: Domesticated, unintelligent creatures. | Rider's | [Dash](dash), [Disengage](disengage), [Dodge](dodge)
| **Independent**: Intelligent, sentient creatures. | Mount's | No restrictions on [actions](actions-in-combat)
{.gray .small-text}

If the mount provokes and [attack of opportunity](opportunity-attack), the attacker may target the mount or the rider.

> A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
> 
> **Mounting and Dismounting**<br/>
> Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of [movement](movement) equal to half your speed. 
>
> If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a [DC](difficulty-class) 10 [Dexterity](dexterity) [saving throw](saving-throw) or fall off the mount, landing [prone](prone) in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked [prone](prone) while mounted, you must make the same [saving throw](saving-throw). 
>
> If your mount is knocked [prone](prone), you can use your [reaction](reaction) to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall [prone](prone) in a space within 5 feet it.
>
> **Controlling a Mount**<br/>
>
> While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.
> 
> You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The [initiative](initiative) of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: [Dash](dash), [Disengage](disengage), and [Dodge](dodge). A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. 
>
> An independent mount retains its place in the The [initiative](initiative) order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the [actions](actions-in-combat) the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes. 
>
> In either case, if the mount provokes an [opportunity attack](opportunity-attack) while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.
