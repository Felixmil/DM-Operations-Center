- Initiated when a creature moves out of reach.
- Occurs before the creature moves out of reach.
- Requires the attacker to use their [reaction](reaction).
- The [disengage](disengage) prevents the use of an AoO.
- Not triggered if the target isn't using [movement](movement).


> You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your [reaction](reaction) to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. 
> 
> You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the [Disengage](disengage) action. You also donâ€™t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your [movement](movement), [action](actions-in-combat), or [reaction](reaction).
