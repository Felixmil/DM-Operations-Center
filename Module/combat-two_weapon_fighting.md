### Two Weapon Fighting
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Combat](combat) > Two Weapon Fighting {.small-text}

- Must use [action](actions-in-combat) to attack to get [bonus attack](bonus-action).
- Both [weapons](weapons) must have the [light](weapon-properties) property.
- [STR](strength) or [DEX](dexterity) [mod](ability-modifier) is not added unless it is negative.
- Allowed for [ranged attacks](ranged-attack) with [thrown](weapon-properties) property.

> When you take the [Attack](melee-attack) action and attack with a [light](weapon-properties) melee [weapon](weapons) that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a [bonus action](bonus-action) to attack with a different [light](weapon-properties) melee [weapon](weapons) that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your [ability modifier](ability-modifier) to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.
>
> If either [weapon](weapons) has the [thrown](weapon-properties) property, you can [throw the weapon](ranged-attack), instead of making a [melee attack](melee-attack).
