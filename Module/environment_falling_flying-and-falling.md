### Flying & Falling
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Environment & Hazards](environment-and-hazards) > [Falling](falling) > Flying & Falling {.small-text}

A flying creature is [falling](falling) if
- it is knocked [prone](prone)
- its speed is reduced to 0
- it loses the ability to fly
{.square}

If the creature begins to fall, but has not lost the ability to fly and has movement left, it can use this movement to reduce the total fall distance.

**Distance = Height - Remaining Fly Speed** {.text-center}

If a creature is knocked [prone](prone) at a height greater than 500 feet, it may use half it's movement to "stand up" and resume flying on its next turn.
