### Cast Spell
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Combat](combat) > [Action](action) > Cast Spell {.small-text}

**Cast a spell with a [casting time](casting-time) of 1 action.** {.text-center}

***Note**: If a character casts a [bonus action](bonus-action) spell, any spell cast using their action **MUST** be a cantrip.*
{.square}

> Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an [action](action), a [reaction](reaction), minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an [action](action). Most spells do have a casting time of 1 [action](action), so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.
