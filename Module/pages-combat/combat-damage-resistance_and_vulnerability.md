> If a creature or an object has resistance to a [damage type](damage-type), damage of that type is halved against it. 
> 
> If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a [damage type](damage-type), damage of that type is doubled against it.

> Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage. 
> 
> Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same [damage type](damage-type) count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
