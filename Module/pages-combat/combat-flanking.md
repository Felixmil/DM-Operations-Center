[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Combat](combat) > Flanking {.small-text}

A creature is flanking an enemy if it has at least one ally adjacent to an enemy **and** on opposite sides of the enemy.

Attackers flanking an enemy have [advantage](advantage-and-disadvantage) on their [attacks](melee-attack) against that creature.

***Flanking is an optional rule.***
