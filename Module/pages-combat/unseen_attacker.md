> When you attack a target that you can't see, you have [disadvantage](advantage-and-disadvantage) on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly. 
> 
> When a creature can't see you, you have [advantage](advantage-and-disadvantage) on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.
