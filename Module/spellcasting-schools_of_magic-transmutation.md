### Transmutation
[Home](dm-operations-center) > [Spellcasting](spellcasting) > [Schools of Magic](schools-of-magic) > Transmutation {.small-text}

**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

***Examples**: [Alter Self](/spell/alter-self), [Enlarge/Reduce](/spell/enlarge-reduce), [Haste](/spell/haste), [Heat Metal](/spell/heat-metal), [Polymorph](/spell/polymorph), [Slow](/spell/slow)*
