# MrFarland's DM Operations Center
MrFarland's DM Operations Center is an add-on module for the EncounterPlus virtual tabletop system for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The module is designed to help dungeon masters manage their game entirely from within the EncounterPlus application and without the need to consult numerous books, web sites, apps, or screens during their tabletop role-playing game session.

## Audience
This module was designed specifically for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons dungeon masters and users of the EncounterPlus virtual tabletop system.



## Features
Some of the core features I hope to provide include, but are not limited to:
- Randomly generate content from pre-populated lists as well as provide the full list.
- The ability to quickly copy & paste generated content and add it to your campaign.
- Hosted on GitHub to allow people to create a branch and customize the module for their needs.
- Released under Creative Commons - Noncommercial - Sharealike license.
