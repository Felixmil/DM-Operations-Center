# Summary
MrFarland's DM Operations Center is a add-on module for the EncounterPlus virtual tabletop system for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The module is designed to help dungeon masters manage their game entirely from within the EncounterPlus application and without the need to consult numerous books, web sites, apps, or screens during their tabletop role-playing game session.

## Audience
This module was designed specifically for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons dungeon masters and users of the EncounterPlus virtual tabletop system.

## Tools
This module hopes to provide 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons dungeon masters with the following tools:
- **Calendars**. A tool to track the passage of in-game time and events for new and existing worlds.
- **DM Screen**. A searchable index of common rules and tables to function as a virtual DM screen.
- **Challenge**. A new kind of encounter builder that feels less random & less combat-centric. 
- **NPC Manager**. A simple tool to quickly create new NPCs and keep track of the old ones.
- **Puzzle Book**. A collection of tables and tools to quickly create puzzles of various difficulties.
- **Shop Keeper**. Quickly generate new shops, stock them, and hire staff for a variety of businesses.
- **Sim Settlement**. Generators and tables to build realistic settlements for build-as-you-go games.
- **Trap Builder**. A collection of tables and tools to build various types of traps and setbacks.
- **Weather Machine**. A realistic weather generator based on climate zone and season.
- **Other Random Generators**. Names, locations, books, spell books, illnesses, and so much more.


## Features
Some of the core features I hope to provide include, but are not limited to:
- Randomly generate content from pre-populated lists as well as provide the full list.
- The ability to quickly copy & paste generated content and add it to your campaign.
- Hosted on GitHub to allow people to create a branch and customize the module for their needs.
